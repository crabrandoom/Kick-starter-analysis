# Kick-starter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to take a closer look at the individual characteristics of kickstarter campaigns to determine trends in the data what variables and criteria define a successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge I personally had was with the outcomes based on goals chart. Having missed a step an not filtering by "plays" my data was somewhat similar but obviously not exactly the same. I verified my formulas were calculating everything correctly before I consulted the class for further clarification if the chart in the example was to match our results exactly.

## Results

February through May have a considerably higher Successful vs Failed campaign rate than any other months.

The ratio of Successful vs Failed Campaigns in the months of December - Jaunary and August - September is consierably lower than in any other months.

Campaigns with Goals in the 35k range to the 45k range have the highest chance of success.

Campaigns with Goals in between 1k to 5k and 45k or greater are the least likely to succeed.

A limited set of years of data was used. If there were more years of data included a more comprehensive analysis could be made.

A chart of the Outcomes based on Launch Date by year would be useful to quickly pick out the lesser preforming years. If there are cyclical trends in the launch dates month to month, then it might be worthwhile to see what they are year to year.
